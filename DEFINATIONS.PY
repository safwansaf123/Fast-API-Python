# create folder via uv init FAST-API
# NOW INSTALL FAST API
# uv add fastapi[standard]
#dependencies installed
# create program to call or test get-api
# now run function
#fastapi dev main.py
# server   Server started at http://127.0.0.1:8000
# server   Documentation at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs ------> this will work like postman

# WHAT IS SWAGGER UI
#Swagger UI is a popular open-source tool for API documentation and testing. 
# It allows developers to visualize and interact with the APIâ€™s resources without having any of the implementation logic in place. 
# This makes it easier for both backend implementation and client-side consumption

'''Swagger UI''' #is focused on creating interactive API documentation and 
#providing a user-friendly interface for testing APIs directly from the documentation.

'''Postman''' # offers a comprehensive set of tools for API development, testing, and collaboration, 
#making it suitable for managing the entire API lifecycle.
